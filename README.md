## Presentation

**The purpose of this mini application is to show my technical skills when it comes to searching for information from an api**.

The principle is simple: it's an application that gathers the news by theme. You can easily select the category that interests you via the navigation menu.

For each category, I will look up the last 20 most recent articles in different newspapers. 4 items are displayed per page and a homemade pagination allows to navigate between these different pages.

![homePage](src/assets/gitimages/home.png?raw=true "Main Page")

**When you are interested in an article,** if you click the button you are redirected to the source site that opens in a new tab.

There you go! **Note that the site is fully responsive**, for example on Iphone X:

![responsive](src/assets/gitimages/responsive.png?raw=true "Responsive")

## Technologies used
![React](src/assets/gitimages/reactlogo.png?raw=true "React")
![Bootstrap](src/assets/gitimages/logobootstrap.jpg?raw=true "Bootstrap")


Itâ€™s an application made entirely with React. I used React Router for routing and Axios to make the queries to api. Bootstrap was used for fast formatting and responsive was made via the Media Queries in CSS.
